    <h3>Churches and Sanctuaries</h3>
    <p>
      Taking Sanctuary in a house of worship can be very useful in helping the immigrants to feel safe and become calm. Then they can gather pieces of information on what to do next and make good plans for the future. This usually would happen in the event of immigration raids or acts of hate occurring in certain areas. In addition, immigrants face day-to-day struggles that faith communities should be ready to address through the short-term sanctuary.
