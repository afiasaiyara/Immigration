      <b>Description:</b> As a Co-Managing Partner of LARRABEE ALBI COKER LLP, Fausta shares responsibility for all aspects of Firm management, direction and oversight; provides legal counsel on immigration matters to corporate clients, universities and research institutes, and individuals; monitors changes in immigration laws, agency regulations and policies; and liaises and corresponds with various U.S. government agencies.
      A child of immigrants from the region of Calabria in Southern Italy, Fausta had first-hand experience in the challenges and benefits of assimilating traditional Italian culture and familial expectations with the independent culture and diverse opportunities of the United States.  An appreciation of languages and cultures fostered since childhood developed into an interest in international human rights, global socio-economic and political issues, and social service.  Experience in social work with at-risk teenagers led to an interest in law school, with a goal of obtaining the tools to make a difference at the policy level.  In law school, Fausta discovered the field of immigration.  It seemed a good match, as the field requires a commitment to social justice and human rights, as well as an understanding of international affairs and economic and political concerns.  Fausta’s practice in the field of immigration law has evolved to a heavier focus on the interplay of a global economy and a globally mobile workforce, to which the Firm dedicates its energies today.Fausta provides legal counsel on immigration matters as primary attorney to corporate clients, research institutes and universities, predominantly in the Information Technology, Biotechnology, Education, and Scientific Research sectors.   Specifically, she advises on legal issues related to procuring all types of employment-based nonimmigrant visas (including B-1, H-1B, L-1A/B, TN-1/2, O-, E-1/2, E-3); labor certifications (PERM and special handling); employment-based immigrant visa petitions (Extraordinary Ability, Multinational Executive/Manager, Outstanding Researcher, National Interest Waiver, and labor certification-based petitions); adjustment of status and consular processing issues, for both employment-based and family-based cases; and naturalization.  She also advises on the immigration consequences of mergers, acquisitions, and reductions in force; as well as compliance with I-9, E-Verify, and worksite enforcement issues.  Fausta is a frequent speaker on immigration issues both in the San Diego community and nationally; is active in liaison groups with government agencies; and is active in national and community-based immigration advocacy organizations.  Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Fausta is a dual U.S. and Canadian citizen.   She is proficient in Spanish and French, and conversational in Italian.

Mercedes supports her firm’s offices and clients across various states on immigration employment transfers and up-to-date compliance. As an immigrant herself, Mercedes finds particular fulfillment in helping companies and individuals immigrate to the United States and participate in the American dream through startups and business transactions that also can benefit the U.S. economy. Mercedes attributes much of her practice today to her dedication to resourcefulness from years of experience, meticulous preparation and organization skills. This entails a thorough understanding of her client’s industry, operations, culture, practices and financial goals in order to lay out realistic expectations and alternative strategies, as needed. Mercedes believes in being organized in her approach and documentation as a way of helping her clients manage costs. She and her team are committed to employing systems-driven tracking, timely updates and follow-ups with clients, and being pragmatic when unexpected issues arise. Mercedes advises on a range of employment-based immigration needs, including temporary (nonimmigrant) and permanent (immigrant) visas for executives, managers, investors, professionals, aliens of extraordinary ability, and essential, specialized and skilled workers. She works hand-in-hand with clients on their corporate global mobility policies and compliance documentation regarding sponsoring foreign nationals for employment-based visa classifications. She is regularly involved in I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification (EEV) and H-1B Labor Condition Application compliance.Mercedes also provides in-house and on-site training on immigration planning for personnel transfers, immigration-related due diligence for mergers and acquisitions, consular applications, and naturalization and citizenship initiatives. She guides clients through internal immigration program administration and monitoring, and trains human resource personnel and other managers on the evolving areas of immigration law and practical integration of immigration policies, procedures and compliance statutes to everyday business operations.Born in Cuba and bilingual in Spanish and English, Mercedes has sincere compassion for and sensitivity to her clients, keenly aware of the legal land mines and tedious pathways they would navigate through the U.S. immigration system. Whether Mercedes is advising on an immigration matter for an individual relocating from abroad, transferring within the U.S. from another employer, entering the U.S. workforce from student status, looking to build a U.S. business or someone part of a cultural exchange program, she provides her experience with the same strong zeal and commitment toward the best outcome.Notably, Mercedes has been featured on NPR and Spanish-language broadcasts on immigration topics, many of which included audience call-ins. Prior to joining Barnes & Thornburg, Mercedes had built her own legal practice over nine years as the founding partner of Badia-Tavas Law Group, representing similar categories of clients she now services, with a little more individual and family-type immigration cases involved. She has traveled and lived throughout Latin America.

    <h3>Churches and Sanctuaries</h3>
    <p>
      Taking Sanctuary in a house of worship can be very useful in helping the immigrants to feel safe and become calm. Then they can gather pieces of information on what to do next and make good plans for the future. This usually would happen in the event of immigration raids or acts of hate occurring in certain areas. In addition, immigrants face day-to-day struggles that faith communities should be ready to address through the short-term sanctuary.
