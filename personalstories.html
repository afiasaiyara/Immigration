<p>PLAIN DEALING, La. — The American dream to live in absolute freedom; safe from the threats, persecution, violence, psychological torture and even death the Cuban dictatorship has imposed on me because of my journalistic work fell apart in my hands as soon as I arrived in Louisiana. The Cubans here who are also seeking protection from the U.S. government welcomed me to the Bossier Parish Medium Security Facility with an ironic surprise. They opened their arms and told me, “Welcome to hell!”</p>

<p>I could hardly believe they have spent nine, 10 and even 11 months asking, waiting for a positive response from immigration authorities in their cases.</p>

<p>I was under the illusion that after an asylum official who interviewed me at the Tallahatchie County Correctional Center in Tutwiler, Miss., on March 28 determined I had a “credible fear of persecution or torture” in Cuba, one hearing with an immigration judge would be enough to obtain my conditional release and pursue my case in freedom as U.S. law allows. But I was wrong. The locals (here at Bossier) once again took it upon themselves to dash my hopes. </p>

<p>“Nobody comes out of Louisiana!” they proclaimed.</p>

<p>It only took a few minutes for my dream, like that of many others, to turn into a nightmare. The more than 30 migrants who arrived in Louisiana on the afternoon of May 3, coming from Mississippi after more than a month detained at Tallahatchie, were plunged into a deep depression that continues today. Only the tears under the blanket that nobody can see are able to ease my desperation for a few minutes and then I once again feel it in my chest when I think of my family in Cuba who continues to receive threats of jail and death from the Cuban dictatorship because of my work with “media outlets of the enemy.” This reality is the only thing that awaits me back there. I therefore see the situation in Louisiana and I am once again afraid. I cannot see an exit. Prisoner here, prisoner if I return to Cuba. I feel trapped.</p>

<h2><strong>Violation of their own laws</strong></h2>

<p>I realized a few days after I arrived in Louisiana the subjectivity of who makes the decisions matters, not objectivity or attachment to those who are being held. Louisiana
feels like a lost piece of “gringo” geography at which nobody seems to look, or to the contrary, it is a coldly calculated strategy that triumphs on authoritarianism, abuse of power or intransigence. I don’t know what to think.</p>

<p>More than a few who have arrived here have come to the conclusion the U.S. has made migrants its new business. Keeping migrants in their custody for so long keeps hundreds of employees and lawyers in business, as well as generating huge profits for the prisons with which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts. It has become clear the government prefers to waste more than $60 a day per migrant than set us free under our own recognizance.</p>

<p>“Louisiana is an anti-immigrant state,” Arnaldo Hernández Cobas, a 55-year-old Cuban man whose asylum process has taken 11 months, tells me. “It is not possible for any of the thousands of people who go through the process to leave victorious.” </p>

<p>Hernández tells me ICE agents have not met with him once during his confinement and the deportation officer has never seen him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if I am allowed to have bail,” he says. “Judge Grady A. Crooks affirms that we do not qualify for this and he does not give it to those who qualify for it because they can flee. This only happens in this state because migrants in other places are released and can pursue their cases on the outside after they make bail.”</p>

<p>Another way to obtain conditional freedom is through parole, a benefit the federal government offers to asylum petitioners who enter the country legally and are found to have a credible fear of suffering, facing persecution or being tortured in their countries of origin. </p>

<p>“To grant it, ICE asks for a series of questions that relatives should send to them, but what is happening is that they don’t give them enough time to do so,” says Arnaldo.</p>

<p>This is exactly what happened with me.</p>

<p>My family managed to send the documents the next day for my parole interview, which was scheduled for the following day. ICE nevertheless denied me parole because I did not prove “that I am not a danger to society.” I am sure they didn’t even take my case seriously.</p>

<p>There are stories that border on the absurd because many migrants have received their parole hearing notifications the same day they should have filed their documents. One therefore feels as though ICE mocks you to your face and your feelings of helplessness reach the max.</p>

<p>The awarding of parole is a new procedure ICE must complete, but it does not go beyond that. They use this and other crafty strategies to “stay good” in the eyes of the law and they therefore keep asylum seekers in custody for months. They bring them to hearings they will not win, pushing for the deportation of those who do not succumb to the pressure of confinement without
properly assessing the risk to their lives that returning to their native countries would entail.</p>

<p>ICE is required to free us a few days after it grants parole, and we already know it doesn’t want to do this. Their goal is to keep us locked up at all costs.</p>

<p>“The cruel irony is that the majority of asylum seekers who follow the law and present themselves at official ports of entry don’t have to ask an immigration judge for their release from custody,” declared Laura Rivera, a lawyer for
the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that provides legal assistance to immigrants, in an article titled, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/stuck-hell-cuban-asylum-seekers-wither-away-louisiana-immigration-prisons">“Stuck
in ‘hell’: Cuban asylum seekers wither away in Louisiana immigration prisons.”</a> “To the contrary, their only avenue to secure their freedom is to ask the same agency that detains them, the Department of Homeland Security.”</p>

<p>But DHS — as Rivera details in the article published by the Southern Poverty Law Center — is ignoring its mandate to consider requests for release in detail. And to the contrary it denies conditional release without justification.</p>

<p>“Men are kept hidden from the outside world, locked up and punished for defending their rights and are forced to bring their cases before immigration judges who deny them with rates of up to 100 percent,” affirmed Rivera. </p>

<p>Another of the process violations in Arnaldo’s case was he was assured where he was first detained that he could win his case along with that of his wife, “but when he came” to Louisiana the judge “told me this was not allowed, that each case is different.” Arnaldo’s life cannot be different from that of his wife because they have been together for 37 years. His wife has been free for nine months, but he remains behind bars. And so, it happens with mothers and sons, brothers and people who have identical cases. Once again, subjectivity determines a person’s fate.</p>

<p>During his
hearing with Crooks, Arnaldo declared he feels “very uncomfortable”
because he considers him an extremist. </p>

<p>“He
said that he only recognizes extreme cases,” says Arnaldo. “Doors
mean nothing to him. He describes himself as a deportation judge, not an asylum
judge. In the entire time that I have been here nobody has won asylum, not even
bail, only deportations.”</p>

<p>Conclusive
proof of the judge’s extremism came one day when another judge ran the hearings
and the migrants who presented their cases that morning received asylum. The
example could not have been more illustrative.</p>

<p>Douglas
Puche Moxeno, a 23-year-old Venezuelan man who has spent nine months in
Louisiana, also said the detainees “did not receive more information on
how the process should be followed and how one should do it.” </p>

<p>“I
don’t know if they explained to us the ways to obtain a conditional release,”
he says.</p><!--Ad Injection:random--><div id="div-gpt-ad-1396561196163-1" style="width: 300px; height: 250px; float: left; margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 5px;" data-google-query-id="CLallfzC8-MCFcQWhwodInYCZg">

<p>In relation to their hearings, Douglas says “the judge told me that he knew the real situation in Venezuela, but he did not grant me asylum because I am not an extreme case. He is waiting for someone to come to the United States without an arm or a leg to be accepted.”</p>

<p>The migrants in Louisiana are trying every way possible to be released. They have made these complaints on television stations and have even gone to Cuban American U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).</p>

<p>“We have reached the point of filing a lawsuit against ICE,” Douglas explains.
“A team of lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center have proposed a
lawsuit seeking a reconsideration of parole. This is one of the most hopeful
ways that we have to obtain freedom. If we are successful, the benefits will be
for everyone.”</p>

<p>“Various protests to pressure authorities and to reclaim our rights as immigrants have been organized,” says Douglas. “Relatives, lawyers and various
institutions have come together in Miami, Washington and even here in Louisiana
to make ICE aware of the injustices that have been committed against us for more
than a year.”</p>

<h2><strong>‘This is not your country’</strong></h2>

<p>Bossier is a jail deep in Louisiana, hidden in the woods that surround it. Each day inside of it is a constant struggle for survival that takes a huge toll on my physical, psychological and above all emotional capacities. More than 300 migrants live in four dorms in cramped conditions with intense cold and zero privacy.</p>

<p>My stay
here reminds me of the school dorms in Cuba where we were forced to share
smells, tastes and basic needs. Here we also share Hindu, African, Chinese,
Nepali, Syrian and Central American migrants’ beliefs, cultures and ways of
life.</p>

<p>My personal space is reduced to a narrow metal bed that is bolted to the floor, a drawer for my things and a thin mattress that barely manages to keep my spine separated from the metal, which sometimes causes back pain. The most painful thing, however, is the way the officers treat us. For “better or for worse,” you feel as though you are a federal prisoner. </p>

<p>“According
to ICE, we are ‘detainees,’ not prisoners, but we have still suffered physical
and psychological abuses,” says Arnaldo. “I remember one time when an
official dragged a Salvadoran man to the hole for three days simply for eating
in his bed. They don’t offer anything to us and they don’t talk to us, they
yell. They wake you up by kicking the bed.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>“The
slightest pretext is used to disconnect the microwave, the television or deny
us ice, affirming this is a luxury and not a necessity,” alleges Arnaldo.
“When we complain about these situations. They tell us, ‘This is not your
country.'”</p>

<p>Smiles are
not common inside the dorm. The faces of affliction and sadness predominate.
Good news is almost always false and the frustration and stress this
confinement causes us therefore returns.</p>

<p>“I
feel very sad, afflicted here, as though I had killed someone because of the
mistreatment that we receive, the place’s conditions,” declares Damián
Álvarez Arteaga, a 31-year-old man who has spent 11 months as a prisoner in the
U.S. </p>

<p>“Freedom
is the most precious thing a human being has,” he adds. “I hope that
I will receive a positive response to my case after spending so much time
detained. We have demonstrated to the U.S. that we are truly afraid of
suffering persecution or torture in Cuba.”</p>

<p>Hours in
here seem to have no end: They stretch, they multiply, but they never shorten
or pass quickly. Our only contact with the outside the world are telephone
communications or video calls (at elevated prices) with relatives, friends or
lawyers and sporadic trips to the patio to greet the son and take fresh air.</p>

<p>“In
all of the time that I have been here, I have seen the son a few times and only
for 15 minutes and this is because we have complained,” recalls Arnaldo. </p>

<p>The yard,
as we also call it, is a small rectangle of fences and surveillance cameras
with a cement surface at the center of it where some of us play soccer when
they give us a ball. I roll the pants of my yellow uniform up to my knees to
allow the sun to warm my extremities a bit while my eyes wander towards the
lush forest that is a few meters away from me. I admire the sky, the few
vehicles that are driving on the nearby highway and I take deep breaths of
oxygen because I know I had just come out of the deep sea and desperately
needed air to keep me alive.</p>

<p>“Everyday is the same here from the same food to the same activities,” says Douglas. “This prison does not have sufficient spaces to accommodate so many people for so long. We don’t have a library or family visits.”</p>

<h2><strong>‘Soup is currency’</strong></h2>

<p>My day at Bossier begins a bit before 5 a.m. With the call to “line-up,” I receive a plastic tray with my breakfast. Today is cereal day, low-fat milk, bread and a small portion of jelly. The menu is the same each day of the week. I always save part of it because there is nothing more to eat until midday.</p>

<p>“The food is not correct,” opines Damián. “My stomach is already used to that small portion. A piece of bread with hot sauce and some vegetables or mortadella cannot sustain an adult man, nor can it keep you in shape to resist such a stressful process.”</p>

<p>The last meal of the day is at 4 p.m., and because of this it is a fantasy to be in bed at 11 p.m. with a full stomach. I reduce the hunger pains with an instant soup to which I add some carrots and a hot dog that I steel for myself from the day’s meals.</p>

<p>Since I still have some money, I can buy soups and extra things to make Bossier’s bad food a little better. Bossier classifies those who don’t receive economic support from their families as “indigent” and they are forced to clean up for their fellow detainees in exchange for a Maruchan soup. Here soup is currency. Everything begins and ends with it, the savior of hungry nights.</p>

<p>“You
can buy these and other things at elevated prices in the commissary, the only
store to which we have access and for which we depend on everything,” says
Damián. </p>

<p>Bossier’s
medical services on the other hand are so basic that there is not even a doctor
or nurse on call, nor is there an observation room for patients and
consultations only take place from Monday to Friday. </p>

<p>“One
who gets sick is put in punishment cells, isolated and alone, which
psychologically affects us,” notes Arnaldo. “People sometimes don’t
say they don’t feel well because they are afraid they will be sent to the
‘well.’ In extreme cases they bring you to a hospital with your feet, hands and
waist shackled and they keep you tied to the bed, still under guard. I prefer
to suffer before being hospitalized like that.” </p>

<p>Yuni Pérez
López, a 33-year-old Cuban, experienced this unfortunate situation first hand.
He was on the hole for six days because he had a fever. </p>

<p>“I
felt as though I was being punished for being sick,” he says. “And
even when the doctor discharged me, they kept me there. It was like being in an
icebox: Four walls, a bed, a toilet and a light that never turns off. To leave
from there I had to stop eating for an entire day to get the officials’
attention and they returned me to the dormitory.”</p>

<p>Bossier also leaves you chilled to the bone because we cannot use blankets or sheets to cover ourselves from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. It is not a question of esthetic or discipline because the officials are not interested in whether your bed is made well. The only thing that bothers them is when we are cover ourselves from the dorm’s intense cold.</p>

<p>The migrants interviewed by the Washington Blade are those who have been at Bossier the longest. They are all appealing Crooks’ decision not to grant them political asylum. I have not presented my case yet, so I am still a little hopeful that I will receive the protection of the U.S. Like them, I am trying to get used to this harsh reality and be strong, although most of the time sadness consumes me and erases positive thoughts. </p>

<p>The U.S. to me — like for many — does not represent a comfortable life, the newest car or McDonald’s. None of this will ever be able to fill the void of my family, friends or passionate love that I left behind. The U.S. represents the opportunity to LIVE, so I will hold on to it until the end.</p>

  <h2>'Dreams From My Undocumented Father: Story of a Deportation' by Belsy Garcia Manrique</h2>

  <div class="posttext2">

  <p><i>“Me van a djar detenido, mija. Sigue adelante, mija. Tu puedes.”<b> </b></i>(They are going to detain me, my child. Keep going, my child. You can do it.)</p>
<p>The day they took him was January 23, 2018. My dad has had to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (<span class="caps">ICE</span>) since 2011. Of course, we always knew there was a risk that he could be detained at any check-in. So you prepare yourself mentally, but you’re always hoping it’s never going to happen.</p>
<p>This time around, our fears were even worse, because we heard rumors that immigration officials were basically taking everyone who showed up, regardless of their criminal background. Normally my two sisters or I would go with him and stay with him until he was released. But this time, they did not allow my younger sisters into the building.</p>
<p>I was at home in Chicago that day, as I didn’t have any clinical duties at the hospital. I was waiting by my phone, hoping to receive a call from him saying, “Hey, everything is fine.” But I was worried and couldn’t focus on studying, so I was just sitting there. And then I get the text from him: <i>“Me van a djar detenido, mija.”</i></p>
<p>That’s when the tears came, when your biggest fears become a reality. I was crying for a while. Then I had to compose myself, call my mom to see how she was doing and call my sisters. I couldn’t say anything to my youngest sister. I couldn’t console her in any way. We always knew this was a risk. What is there to do?</p>
<p>We’re a mixed immigration-status family. I am at the end of my third year of medical school at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine and <a href="https://www.newsdeeply.com/refugees/articles/2017/02/15/dreamer-doctors-fear-deportation-under-trump-migrant-crackdown" target="_blank" class="preview-link">have temporary protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (<span class="caps">DACA</span>) program. My middle sister has a green card because she is married to a <span class="caps">U.S.</span> citizen. My younger sister is a <span class="caps">U.S.</span> citizen because she was born here. She is 19 years old and a sophomore in college.</p>
<p>My dad comes from San Marcos, Guatemala. He came to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> because he had been getting anonymous notes from people telling him to stop what he was doing. While getting his accounting diploma, he was president of a student association and began raising questions about the political climate and saying people should learn to think for themselves. That didn’t suit some people, and they were threatening to kill him. Once, he was assaulted: a couple of men beat him up. When he got out of hospital he went to the authorities, but they did nothing because he didn’t have names. He was scared for his life.</p>
<p>In 1995 he arrived in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> He filed for asylum in 1997 but his application was denied. He didn’t have a lawyer. He didn’t have a Spanish interpreter during the court proceedings, either. He didn’t know he could appeal, so he didn’t appeal. Not understanding that changed his case. If he had appealed, maybe this story would be totally different.</p>
<p>I arrived in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> in 1997 with my mom and younger sister. We crossed the Rio Grande River. They put me on a floating tire and pulled me across. And I just remember knowing I was making my way to see my daddy because I hadn’t seen him in two years.</p>
<p>Growing up in Georgia, we didn’t have insurance, so we couldn’t go to the doctor very often. There’d be times we would go and none of the doctors spoke Spanish, so either my dad translated or I translated. My dad always pushed me to help others, because he always did the same. We were always taking people into our house if we had an extra room or extra food. I saw how selfless my dad was and how he was willing to share anything he had. He was always saying, “We came to this country for a better future and better opportunities. Having those opportunities gives you the ability to help others.”</p>
<div class="left-side-quote-block"><p>“We came to this country for a better future and better opportunities. Having those opportunities gives you the ability to help others.”</p></div>
<p>Those values instilled in me by him have taught me to be a kind human being. And that’s what I want to do as a family physician. I want to work in underserved areas and help those who need it the most. As physicians, it’s important to treat everyone regardless of race, religion, background and even immigration status.</p>
<p>My dad has always been extremely driven. He’s owned a trucking company, and when I was in high school he owned a tortilla company. Recently he’s taken an interest in buying foreclosed homes around Calhoun, Georgia, remodeling them and selling them. He buys the land, hires contractors and construction workers and gets building permits. He’s creating jobs and generating revenue for the city.</p>
<p>Throughout this whole ordeal, my dad has constantly told me and my sisters that he has learned a lot from this country. He loves this country and sees it as his home. He’s thankful for all the opportunities he’s able to have been a part of. He’s even said he’d fight for this country. And he doesn’t want to leave.</p>
<p>When I told my dad I wanted to go to medical school, I was expecting some hesitation from him. We knew that as a family we’d undergo some financial strain for me to attend undergraduate studies because, being undocumented at the time, I couldn’t receive financial aid. But he never showed any hesitation. He said, “Ok, let’s do this.”</p>
<p>There have certainly been times when I would doubt myself or thought I wasn’t good enough. I thought the chances of getting into medical school were extremely thin because of my legal status, so why even try? But he was always in my corner, pushing me. With his support, I managed to make it this far. Right now, I just started my clinical rotations at the Veterans Administration Hospital outside Chicago. I follow up on veterans who are hospitalized for any psychiatric issue and monitor them on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>My <span class="caps">DACA</span> work permit is until 2020. Currently, I cannot get a green card or become a <span class="caps">U.S.</span> citizen. <span class="caps">DACA</span> is a band-aid, not a permanent solution. Immigration reform has to happen. The spotlight has been on Dreamers, and that’s great, but there’s millions of other people who also deserve the opportunity to become legal permanent residents. They pay their taxes and they don’t have a criminal record, similar to my father. You also hear a lot of, “Dreamers are okay to stay, but we need to blame their parents for bringing them here illegally.” That is wrong. Those parents – my parents – wanted a better future for their children. Every parent should want that.</p>
<div class="left-side-quote-block"><p>He never showed any hesitation. He said, “Ok, let’s do this.”</p></div>
<p>My family is like any other American family. We fight, we bicker, but we also love each other. We’re a very close family. And we all love this country very much. Most of my life has been here in the United States, in the small town of Calhoun, Georgia. The United States is my home. I want my future to be here, and I want my parents’ future to be here.</p>
<p>The political climate has affected us in a very tangible way: We’re being separated. I’m losing my father, and I don’t know when I’ll be able to get him back. Regardless of everything that’s going on, America is where I want to practice medicine and work toward a positive impact. Because I grew up here. And I’m going to continue seizing the opportunities that present themselves because of the sacrifices my dad has made for me, for my sisters. I’m not going to let that go in vain, especially with everything he’s going through right now.</p>
<p>When I was home for Christmas break, we talked about the fact that maybe it would be the last time we were going to be together as a family. We started to prepare ourselves. We changed the titles on our cars from my dad’s name to my name, to be able to sell them if we needed to. We changed our bills and put them under my name or my sisters’ names. I have a power of attorney saying my dad gives me permission to do what I think is necessary with the property. Currently we don’t have a breadwinner: both my sisters are in school, I’m in school – and I’m actually getting into more debt with medical school loans. Now I’m responsible for the mortgage. We had to think about all those things.</p>
<p>I went to see my dad last week at Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. It was the first time I’d seen him since New Year’s Day. It was extremely hard, because I only got to see him through a glass window, and I talked to him through a phone. I couldn’t hug him. He was dressed in a jumpsuit. He has lost weight. He’s not as kept as he was. It was strange seeing him. He’s being treated like a criminal. Which frustrates me, because he’s not.</p>
<p>But my dad is always proactive in helping others even when he has little to give, even while in the detention center. We put money in his account, and sometimes he’ll let other detainees use his account to call their families because they were the breadwinners, and their families can’t afford it. He finds ways of helping others that I couldn’t imagine. He’s had me look up shelters because men he’s met in detention were going to be released, and they had nowhere to go. It’s those little things that really make a huge impact on me. Because whatever situation you might find yourself in, there’s always ways of helping others.</p>
<p>The current political climate is not the best for immigrants. Lawyers are constantly telling me this is a trend they have seen for the past several months: People who were not previously targets for deportation – because they had no criminal record, because they were not risks to the community – have become targets. I guess there must be some political gain from this, and that’s the sad thing. Unfortunately, changes in the law have an effect on thousands of families. They’re tearing us apart. I don’t know when will be the next time I will be able to hug my father.</p>
<p>We’ve been asking <span class="caps">ICE</span> to allow my dad to stay here for at least another year until I graduate next May. We filed for a stay of removal, but it was denied. So on April 4, he will be getting on a plane to Guatemala. One half of me will be with my dad, but the other half I need to focus on my education, because I made it this far.</p>
<p class="fin">My dad told me when I went to see him in detention, “If you graduate with your degree, I will be happy. Everything I’m going through and suffering right now, I would do it all over again for you.”</p>

He shifts back and forth, alone on his childhood bed in Santa Lucía, Puebla, in central Mexico. The remote home, where he lives with his mother, rests on a perch overlooking sunburnt hills that skirt near-empty streets. “Since I was deported, I hardly leave my room,” he says. “All of my old friends are now involved in gangs and drugs, so I stay home.”</p>
<p>Vargas’ walls are littered with posters of his favorite sports teams and superheroes from when he was younger. Now 28, he lived in New York from age 15 to 27. Just when he was on the verge of qualifying for DACA, having passed the biometrics screening, and just after his wife had given birth to their son, he was arrested by ICE in April 2017 on his way to work and was deported within a month. The name of his newborn son, Joandri, whom he hasn’t seen in almost two years, is tattooed on his arm.</p>
 <p>Last year, we spent 10 days traversing thousands of miles across the state of Puebla, Mexico, and in later months across New York’s five boroughs in a door-to-door search for stories like Jorge’s. We wanted to put names and faces to the story of deportation—a story that is so often told only through statistics. Numbers alone can’t capture what it’s like to spend years or decades building a life, finding work, starting a family—only to be torn away and made to return to the violent and impoverished place you fled. We focused on the connection between New York, President Donald Trump’s hometown and an icon of prosperity and opportunity, and Jorge’s home state of Puebla, Mexico.</p>
<p>An estimated 1 million undocumented Poblanos live in the United States—one of the largest communities of undocumented Mexican immigrants in the country. Roughly half of those million Poblanos are in New York, where areas like Corona, Queens, have earned the nickname <i>Puebla York</i>. Puebla is the only Mexican state that has a New York office devoted to immigrants, and every year, the Puebla government sponsors reunions of Poblano families, who are allowed to visit their undocumented relatives in the United States on temporary visas for three weeks.</p>
<p>Those who leave Puebla escape the dire poverty of a state where most families earn an average of US $70 a month. More than <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/on-the-margins-why-mexico_b_7967874" target="_blank">60 percent</a> of Puebla’s 6 million people live below the poverty line; many Poblanos resign to labor under the control of cartels in order to stay above it. Meanwhile, an undocumented Mexican construction worker in New York can earn more in a day than he would make in a month in Puebla. Most Poblanos in the United States send much of their earnings back to family below the border. Puebla City, the state capital, received the <a href="http://www.unionpuebla.mx/articulo/2018/11/05/economia/captacion-de-remesas-en-puebla-sexta-nivel-nacional" target="_blank">second highest amount</a> in remittances, after Tijuana, of any city in Mexico in 2018. </p>
<p>Deportations from the United States are on the rise. ICE <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/ero/pdf/eroFY2018Report.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a> 265,085 removals in 2018, the highest number since 2014. In 2018, the greater New York metropolitan area (including Newark, New Jersey) <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/reports/reports.php?layer=immigration&amp;report_type=tool" target="_blank">deported</a> more immigrants than any other city in the country—more than 36,000, of which roughly 4,000 were Mexican. “[T]he overall increase [of deportations both nationally and in New York] was driven primarily by arrests of individuals with no criminal convictions,” according to a report from New York City’s <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/the-demographics-of-detention-immigration-enforcement-in-nyc-under-trump/" target="_blank">comptroller office</a>, which also said, “When looking only at deportations of immigrants with no criminal convictions, New York City experienced the highest increase in enforcement in the nation.” In the first three months of this year alone, more than 1,500 Poblanos were deported from the United States.</p>
<p style="">“ICE does not target individuals on the basis of race, gender or ethnicity,” an ICE spokesperson told us in response to questions about this project. “Our nation welcomes immigrants and has a generous legal immigration system.” Regarding detention and deportation, ICE says it “adheres to rigorous national standards and maximizes access to counsel and visitation, promotes recreation, improves conditions of confinement and ensures quality medical care.” The accounts of the people we spoke to and photographed, however, did not corroborate those statements. Jorge described arriving at his mother’s door in the same work clothes he was wearing the day he was arrested. He had fresh wounds on his wrists and ankles from the shackles ICE eventually removed at the border. “I was treated aggressively by racist guards,” he says. “Police disguised as gang members intimidated me into signing my own deportation papers. I was deported without a court hearing.” (Records confirm that Jorge was removed from the country the day before his appointed court date. ICE would not address the specific allegation of intimidation, though denies any mistreatment.) </p>
<p>The deported Poblanos we met said they arrived home exhausted, ashamed and optionless, outcasts in a country they no longer know—where homicide, femicide, domestic violence and sexual abuse are all at <a href="http://secretariadoejecutivo.gob.mx/docs/pdfs/nueva-metodologia/CNSP-Delitos-2018.pdf" target="_blank">record highs</a>, and less than 10 percent of these crimes are <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/doc/Informes/Especiales/Informe-CEDAW-2018.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a>. With slim economic opportunity, Puebla is a breeding ground for those who seek the American dream—and a cemetery for the dreams of those who return. </p><div class="story-interrupt pos-omega format-l">
